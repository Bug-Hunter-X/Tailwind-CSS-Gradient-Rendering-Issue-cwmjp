```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient utility classes.  However, if the `to-purple-500` class is not available due to a configuration issue (e.g., missing color palettes), the gradient might not render correctly or throw an error in some environments.  It may appear as a solid color or show a broken gradient.
